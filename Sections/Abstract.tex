\textit{We will discuss the effects of change in the magnitude of \textbf{temperature} on the \textbf{solubility} of \textbf{Oxalic acid} in a solutions of different alcohols. We shall accomplish this by collecting raw data on the measurement of \textbf{TDS (Total Dissolved Solids (Dissolved Oxalic acid))} in various alcohols with respect to change in \textbf{temperature} under certain controlled spaces.}

%How does Temperature affect the solubility of Oxalic acid in different solutions of alcohols
