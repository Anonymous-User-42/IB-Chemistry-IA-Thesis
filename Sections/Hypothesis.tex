\textit{The \textbf{drag force} on the \textbf{spherical mass} would act \textbf{inversely proportional} to the the change in \textbf{temperature}, which means that with increase in temperature, the eminent drag force in impact on the spherical mass must decrease,\textbf{drag motion should be an inverse exponential compared to changes in temperature}.}
