{Errors may have crept into our raw and ordered data in various ways. A few probable causes of errors are:}
      
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item {The raw experimental data included in this investigation report was gathered through laboratory experimentation, and there are possible chances that the data acquired may have minor discrepancies in it}
          \item {Random human errors made by the observer, such as parallax errors, which are insignificant.}
          \item {Due to the lack of advanced equipment and the materials employed in the experiment, there are uncertainties that cannot be minimized in this investigation}
          \item {Assumptions and conditions are applied to the system to analyze its dynamic behavior}
      \end{enumerate}
