{The solubility of Oxalic acid in various alcohols (in the order of the hierarchy of the homologous series of alcohols), generally \textbf{decreases} with increase in temperature, ie. \textbf{The solubility in alcohols generally decreases with respect to temperature as the length of the hydrocarbon chain increases}.}
