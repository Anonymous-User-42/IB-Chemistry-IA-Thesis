%\textit{We shall use Oxalic acid as a solute to study the solubility in alcohols as it is a polar protic compound that is highly soluble in polar solvents like water and alcohol. We shall add Oxalic acid in an particular volume of alcohol in excess and observe the changes in the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids - in this case, Oxalic acid) readings with the gradual increase in temperature.}
