\textit{We further define, the average uncertainty in measurement across all cases that have been investigated to be,} 

    $$\overline{F_{D_n}} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{n}F_{D_n}}{n} = \frac{F_{D_1} + F_{D_2} + F_{D_3} + F_{D_4} + F_{D_5}}{5}$$

\textit{Therefore we have,}

    $\overline{F_{D_n}} = 1.258 N = 1.258\times 10^{-3} kN$

\textit{Upon observation, we see that the value of $\overline{F_{D_n}}$ we have found is not equal to 1, but is relatively very close, so we can say that we have some errors in calculating the \textbf{drag force versus temperature}.}
        
        \textit{\textbf{Percentage uncertainty} in measurement of \textbf{drag force versus temperature} is $\left|1-\overline{F_{D_n}}\right|\cdot{100\%} = \textbf{0.1258\%} \approx \textbf{0.13\%}$}
