{When comparing our readings and data from (Syed T. Hussain, Gul A. Khan, et all),we see that if we are to define, $TDS_{expt}$ as the experimentally found TDS for all cases and $TDS_{art}$ as the TDS readings from the research article then we find that our error in the collected data is} 

    $$\overline{TDS_{error}} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{n}{\frac{TDS_{exp}}{TDS_{art}}}}{n} = \frac{\frac{TDS_{exp}}{TDS_{art}} + \frac{TDS_{exp}}{TDS_{art}} + \frac{TDS_{exp}}{TDS_{art}} + \frac{TDS_{exp}}{TDS_{art}} + \frac{TDS_{exp}}{TDS_{art}}}{5}$$

{Therefore we have,}

    $\overline{TDS_{error}} = \pm 1.368 g/L$

{We see that the value of $\overline{TDS_{error}}$ that, we have found is not equal to 1, but is relatively very close to it, so we can say that we have some errors in calculating the \textbf{Total Dissolved Solids in the Alcohol solutions}.}
        
        {\textbf{Percentage uncertainty} in measurement of \textbf{Total Dissolved Solids in the Alcohol solutions} is $\left|1-\overline{TDS_{error}}\right|\cdot{100\%} = \textbf{0.1368\%} \approx \textbf{0.14\%}$}
