\textit{To \textbf{collect experimental raw data} relating to the variation in \textbf{drag force} with the variation in \textbf{temperature} in a lab controlled setting of a \textbf{fluid medium} flow in a \textbf{spherical object} and to compare it with \textbf{computer simulations} of the same and hence study its \textbf{different states} and calculate the value the \textbf{inconsistencies} in \textbf{accuracy} of the \textbf{mathematically modeled computer simulation} to that of the \textbf{actual experiment} and vice-versa.}
