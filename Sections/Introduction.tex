{I have chosen this research question as I was highly interested in Medicinal Chemistry and Medicine, in general. I very well wanted to investigate something that had its application in the medical sciences. I had initially thought of investigating the solubility of Asprin in Alcohol when the alcohol is completely miscible in blood.}

{Preliminary research and data collection have shown me that this is not a feasible topic of study. Observing the solubility of Asprin in Alcohol when the alcohol is completely miscible in blood on the microscopic level is excruciatingly challenging due to the lab constraints at a high-school level. I then decided to study the \textbf{Temperature dependence of the Solubility of Oxalic Acid in various Alcohols} as I had previously researched and studied a lot on the solubility of Alcohols. I chose to Oxalic Acid as my chosen solute as it was easily soluble in alcohols.}
