\textit{I have chosen this research question as I was highly interested in Medicinal Chemistry and Medicine, in general. I very well wanted to investigate something that had its application in the medical sciences. I had initially thought to investigate the Solubility of Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) in various Alcohols; this further led me to study and analyse the temperature dependence on the acid hydrolysis of Acetaminophen (Paracetamol).}

\textit{Preliminary research and data collection have shown me that this is not a feasible topic of study. Observing the hydrolysis on the microscopic level is excruciatingly challenging due to the lab constraints at a high-school level. With the assistance and guidance of my teacher, I decided to study the \textbf{Temperature dependence of the Solubility of Oxalic Acid in various Alcohols} as I had previously researched and studied a lot on the solubility of Alcohols.}
