\textit{Let $F_{{D}_{Exp}}$ be the experimental values and $F_{{D}_{Sim}}$ be the simulation values respectively for each and every case that we are investigating.} 

\textit{If we define $F_{D_n}$ as the uncertainty in measurement in the experimental values of $F_D$, then $F_{D_n}$ is mathematically defined as $\left| F_{{D}_{Sim}} - F_{{D}_{Exp}} \right|$}

\textit{By using the above definitions we have,}

\subsection{\textit{Observation from Case 1 where $T = 20^\circ$C}}

	\textit{By using equation \ref{eq1}, we see that the experimental and simulation value for $F_{D_1}$ is 2.92805 kN and 2.92845 kN.}
        
	\textit{Therefore uncertainty in measurement for $F_{D_1}$ in this case is $\pm{\textit{0.4}}$ N.}

	\textit{By using equation \ref{eq1}, we see that the experimental and simulation value for $F_{D_2}$ is 2.86587 kN and 2.86564 kN.}
        
	\textit{Therefore uncertainty in measurement for $F_{D_2}$ in this case is $\pm{\textit{0.23}}$ N.}
