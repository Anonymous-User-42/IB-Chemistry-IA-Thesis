\textit{Using the materials specified in chapter \ref{mat}, arrange the components as specified in figure \ref{exp1} and make sure that the spherical mass is kept about at a fixed point.}

\textit{Following which, pass through the fluid in a rectangular chamber while varying temperatures and obtain the drag force eminent on the spherical mass.}

\textit{After the prior setup and during the experiment, the fluid must interact with the spherical mass in a manner depicted in figure \ref{exp1}.}
