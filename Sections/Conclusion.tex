{In this paper, I have shown the effects of changes in the \textbf{temperature} on the \textbf{solubility} of Oxalic acid on various \textbf{alcohol solutions} by collecting raw data relating to the above parameters, under certain controlled conditions as so to completely study the \textbf{temperature dependence of solubility of Oxalic acid in various Alcohols with respect to a gradation on the homologous series}.}

%\textit{I have also investigated the \textbf{validity} of our \textbf{initial hypothesis} and have come to a conclusion that our initial hypothesis was an \textbf{partially valid statement}.}

%\textit{I have also shown the possible \textbf{uncertainties in measurement} of \textbf{drag force} with respect to \textbf{temperature}.}
