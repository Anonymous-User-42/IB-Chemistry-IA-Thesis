{In this investigation, I have presented the effect of \textbf{temperature} variations on the \textbf{solubility} of oxalic acid in multiple \textbf{alcohol solutions} through gathering raw data relating to all the parameters under specified lab settings in order to fully investigate the \textbf{temperature dependence of solubility of Oxalic acid in various Alcohols with respect to a gradation on the homologous series}.}

%\textit{I have also investigated the \textbf{validity} of our \textbf{initial hypothesis} and have come to a conclusion that our initial hypothesis was an \textbf{partially valid statement}.}

%\textit{I have also shown the possible \textbf{uncertainties in measurement} of \textbf{drag force} with respect to \textbf{temperature}.}
