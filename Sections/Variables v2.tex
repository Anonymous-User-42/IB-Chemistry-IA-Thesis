%\textit{\textbf{Note}: In theory, the radius of the spherical mass and the flow velocity  incorporated in research could of any arbitrary value. For the purpose of this investigation, we shall specifically use masses of radius $5\times10^{-2}$ m and the flow velocity shall be set constant at 10 m/s.}
